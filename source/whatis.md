# Project Overview

[Python](https://www.python.org/)-based solution for processing seismological data to estimate:

- Sensor misorientation

- Time instability

- Instrumental gain

through analysis of P-wave energy characteristics.

## Methodological Approach

The technique operates under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic medium beneath the seismic station. The workflow involves:

**1. Component Rotation**

Raw seismic signal components (Z, N, E) are transformed into the ZRT coordinate system (Vertical, Radial, Transverse) using earthquake-to-station backazimuth information.

**2. Energy Distribution Analysis**

In an ideal isotropic Earth model:
  - P-wave energy predominantly appears on vertical and radial components
  - Transverse component energy should be minimal

**3. Optimization Process**

We systematically test rotations from 0° to 180° to:
- Minimize transverse component energy
- Determine optimal station misorientation from true north

**4. Statistical Robustness**

The solution incorporates multiple earthquakes from diverse backazimuths to:
- Mitigate local structural effects
- Reduce anisotropy influences
- Enhance measurement reliability

## Key Advantages

- Python Implementation: Leverages Python's scientific computing ecosystem
- Comprehensive Analysis: Simultaneously evaluates multiple instrumentation parameters
- Empirical Validation: Uses real-world seismic events for calibration
